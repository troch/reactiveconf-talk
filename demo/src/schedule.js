In this talk you'll learn how to dramatically cut down development time by using prefabricated, open-source backends like loopback.io and deepstream.io, and how to extend these backends with custom code once your application outgrows the functionality available out of the box. We'll also talk about how prefabricated backends are changing application architectures, and the impact end-to-end event driven application development is making on end-user experience. Weâ€™ll also talk about our journey through the process of solving these problems in RethinkDB and Horizon, and how we see the future of web development unfold. Horizon is an open-source developer platform for building realtime, scalable web apps. It is built on top of RethinkDB, and allows app developers to get started with building modern, engaging apps without writing any backend code.",

This talk will be a deep dive into Elm and React from a production perspectiveâ€”what's familiar, what's different, and how they can work together. We'll start with initial adoption, continue on to shipping new features, and progress all the way through maintenance and scaling. We'll also look at the nontechnical impact of each: hiring, onboarding, and managing technical debt.

However, many applications continue to render purely on the client, and for good reasonâ€”running a React server in production doesn't come without significant challenges. Typically we find ourselves having to choose between these two competing approaches, but there's a lesser-known third optionâ€”using React to pre-render our sites at build time, whether partially or fully. In this talk we'll cover why you'd want to do this in the first place, and how modern tooling can help us achieve it.",
